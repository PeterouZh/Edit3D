# Edit3D

[2024/10/30] Due to unexpected scheduling constraints, the release of the open-source code will be delayed by 2-4 weeks. Thank you for your patience and understanding.

The code will be prepared and open-sourced here by mid-October 2024, in advance of the conference starting on October 28, 2024.
